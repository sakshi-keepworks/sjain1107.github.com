Hey everyone!

This is my first blog after Rails Girls Summer of Code. 
I will continue writing my blog as it will help keep a track of my daily work. 
The Rails Girls Summer of Code was a superb experience of my life. 
It has brought me closer to the open source world and I will continue to contribute to the open source projects. 

Currently I am struggling with executing my Computer Graphics programs on Linux platform.
I am learning OpenGL from this [programming guide](http://www.glprogramming.com/red/).
Let's hope to make it work!

Cheers
Sakshi
